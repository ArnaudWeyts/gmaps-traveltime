# Google Maps Traveltime

A School project using the Google Maps API to calculate time & distance between destinations.
You can input your own traveltimes and get a graphical representation.
The Imgur API is used to upload the graphs and display them for users.

## Building the application

To build the application, run these commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

If your install hangs on npm install, run these commands instead:

```sh
$ sudo rm -rf /node_modules
$ sudo npm install
$ gulp
```

This opens up a tab that connects the the BrowserSync server. (localhost:3000)
